## Pytorch Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions (Work in progress!)

Pytorch implemetation of the paper:

"VISUALIZING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK DECISIONS:
PREDICTION DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS"

This repo implements the methods using the Pytorch framework. 
The original implementation by the Authors can be found here:

link: https://github.com/lmzintgraf/DeepVis-PredDiff

The code is mostly adapted from original the linked git repo.
The classification function replace the used caffe framework with PyTorch

Tested with MobilenetV2

For now: Only use Conditional sampling method
